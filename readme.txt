This plugin lets you place a Facebook Like button on your WordPress blog as a widget. You can easily configure the button.

== Description ==

To use the widget just drag it to a sidebar and choose one of three button styles. You can also choose to show faces, faces will then be shown when using the standard button style. It is also possible to choose between the captions "Like" and "Recommend" and choose between a light and a dark color scheme.

From version 1.3 on you can enter your own title to be displayed above the widget. It is now also possible to use the XFBML version of the Facebook Like button.
